MyPlants
========

MyPlants is a little Android app for management of information about your plants.
You can keep information like dates of acquisition, care, latin name, or anything you like.
Plants are kept in different patches which in turn belong to different gardens. You can for
instance have a separate garden for your summer house plants and those in your apartment. 

The app is compatible with all devices from Android version 2.x Eclair but with a modern
interface like on the Android 4.x Ice Cream Sandwich.
