MyPlants
========

MyPlants is a little utility designed to ease management of information about your plants.
You can keep information like dates of acquisition, care, latin name, or anything you like.
Plants are separated by patches which in turn belong to different gardens. So you can for
instance have a separate garden for your summer house and your apartment. 

The app is compatible with all devices from Android version 2.x Eclair but with a modern
interface like on the Android 4.x Ice Cream Sandwich.
